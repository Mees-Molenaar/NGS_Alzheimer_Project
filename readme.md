# Next-Generation Sequencing Alzheimer's Disease Project

In this project I have used RNA-seq data from this GEO code: [GSE53697](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53697).

The plan is to make a RNA-seq pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook.

I have used the latest human assembly [GRCh38.p13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.39).
